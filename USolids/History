                      -------------------------
This file should be used by developers to briefly summarize all major
modifications introduced in the code and keep track of all tags.
It DOES NOT substitute the SVN log-message one should put at every
committal in the SVN repository !

  installed headers.

January 23,  2015  T.Nikitina 
- Add G4GenericPolycone to SBT test

- Renamed the ExceptionSeverity struct to UExceptionSeverity in UUtils

January 22,  2015  T.Nikitina 
- Fixed triangularisation method AddGeneralPOlygoneFacets() in UExtrudedSolid
  by avoiding flat triangles;
- Add warning message to UTriangularFacet if Area is 0 (case of flat triangle) 

January 22, 2015  T.Nikitina
- Add options to build USolids with Geant4 
- Add missing "SaveDataFiles" to SBT

December 16, 2014 T.Nikitina
- Fix in UPolycone InsideSection for points(0,0,0)
- Fix in UTrap SafetyToIn/SafetyToOut

December 05, 2014 T.Nikitina
- Fixes in UMultiUnion(backporting from geant4/usolids) and improved
  StreamInfo()
- UMultiUnion: simplified and optimised use of transformations; removed
  no longer necessary vector of pointers.
- Minor fixes for UPolycone, UPolyhedra, UTrap, UTet, UCons and UTubs in
  order to pass unit tests and fix errors from Coverity report.

December 05, 2014 T.Nikitina
- Fixes in UPolycone in order to run FullCMS: 
  InsideSection() for openPhi when StartPhi is negative,
  Init() for Polycone defined from ZPlane[0]>ZPlane[N],
  DistanceToOut() for points starting on internal surface.

November 25, 2014 T.Nikitina
- Add "USolidsConfig.cmake.in" and made changes in CMakeLists.txt 
  for installation of USolids library 

October 20, 2014 T.Nikitina
- Fixed use of kInfinity in UGenericTrap implementation.
- Correction to UTessellatedSolid to define post-const attribute for
  UVertexComparator::operator()(), to resolve compilation error on
  Windows/VC9 compiler. Avoid inline static methods.
  Some code formatting.
  Fixed typo error in USphere::SafetyFromInside() (T.Nikitina).
- Corrected compilation warnings for variables set but not used in UTrap,
  UGenericTrap and UTessellatedSolid.
- Modified original UExtrudedSolid, UGenericTrap and UTrap classes to
  provide deferred initialisation through default constructor.
  Added public accessors to UGenericTrap and UTrap.
  Code cleanup in also in UTessellatedSolid to remove G4 types code blocks
  and flags and make use of UUtils::Exception where commented.
- Minor fix in UVector2 to replace use of 's' with 's1' as parameter in
  copy constructor.
- Removed references to G4 types in several classes.
- UCons: fixed typo error in GetPointOnSurface() in the call
  to GetRadiusInRing(). Responsible for occasionally wrong reports
  when checking for overlaps.
  Fix in DistanceToIn(p,v) for points on the Surface, to resolve
  error reported in unit testing by the OpticalEscape test.
- Fix in G4USolid for use of polyhedron, to avoid race condition in MT
  when parameterised volumes are visualised.

October 20, 2014 T.Nikitina
- Change CMakeLists.txt by default no Geant4 installation included,
- May 23, 2014  T.Nikitina                  geom-usolids-V10-00-10
- Fixed DistanceToOut() for UTubs, UCons, USphere, UVSCGfaceted and UPolycone, 
  DistanceToOut() return normal even for concave faces.
- Fixed DistanceToOut() for UPolycone in case of points starting on
  the Surface or on the Internal Surface. Improved convexity algorithm in 
  DistanceToOut() for UPolycone for points leaving +/-Dz. 
- Introducing UMultiUnion class; fix in DistanceToOut(), added protection
  against possible infinite loop, correct treatment of transformations in UMultiUnion and UVoxeliser.

March 27, 2014  G.Cosmo
- Removed unused SaveVectorToExternalFile() methods in UUtils, also
  causing cyclic dependency with UVector3.

March 25, 2014  T.Nikitina
- Fixed DistanceToIn() for UBox in case of points on Edges.

March 13th, 2014 - G.Cosmo
- Fixed use of inline keyword for methods defined in .cc files in UTrd,
  UVCSGfaceted and UVoxelizer.

  to FindComponentFastest().
- Removed unused global variables in UMultiUnion.cc.

March 5th, 2014 - G.Cosmo
- Fixed handling of polyhedron pointer in G4USolid bridge class.

February 21th, 2014 - T.Nikitina            
- Implemented precise safety in UTubs and UCons for SafetyFromOutside().
  Precise safety is used in UPolycone for calculation of SafetyFromOutside().
- UPolycone fixes: added validity check of shape for case when RMin > RMax;
  moved global bounding-box to be a class data member.
  Corrected implementation of DistanceToOut(p,v) for convexity and normals.
  Corrected implementation of DistanceToOut(p,v) for stuck tracks due to
  DistanceToIn=DistanceToOut=0.
  Corrected implementation of Inside() in case of OpenPhi. 

February 12th, 2014 - G.Cosmo
- Corrected implementation of Clone() method in UBox, UTet, UTrd.
